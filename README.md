## üìå Introduction

My personal portfolio is available in PT/BR and EN, built with HTML, CSS, Tailwind, and JS.

It showcases my main contact links, a total of 6 of my key projects, my expertise, and much more!

## üîç About the Interface

## Building the Interface with Tailwind

The interface was built using HTML (for the initial project structure), CSS (for more specific stylings), Tailwind CSS along with its form plugin, and Javascript in combination with TypedJS.

## Responsiveness

The project has been optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens, specifically targeting resolutions of 512px, 720px, 1024px, 1140px, and 1320px.*

<small>*I have chosen to demonstrate only 3 resolutions below.</small>

## üì≤ Media

## üöÄ Conclusion and Next Steps

This project was a great opportunity to enhance my skills in Tailwind, a powerful tool when it comes to creating user interfaces quickly and efficiently.

Although my website is complete, I have decided not to consider it as "final." By merging my own ideas with others I've had throughout the week, I am committed to creating a new, more purpose-oriented layout for potential professional contacts.
